### Mani Nambi

I am an Applied Science Manager at Amazon Robotics where I lead a team developing item manipulation systems. 

Prior to Amazon Robotics, I was a Sr. Research Engineer with Energid Technologies where I developed controls and simulation software for surgical robots, human-safe robotic arms, quadcoptors, and legged robots. 

I received my PhD from University of Utah where I developed a robot for retina surgery.
