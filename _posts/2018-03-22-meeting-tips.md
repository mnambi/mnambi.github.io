title: Organize Effective Meetings

I have always wanted to perfect the art of organizing and executing a productive meeting. There are some great ideas out there such Amazon's two pizza rule[^1]. I have heard from friend's who have worked with Elon Musk that if he calls out people who do not say anything in a meeting. Now we might want to go that ballistic. Like what one of my bosses said, "We don't need genius jerks." So here are my collection of tips for effective meetings.

**1. Define the scope of the meeting**

The organizer should have a clear idea of why he has called the meeting, and what he wants to get out of it. It helps to start the meeting by describing the scope of the meeting and putting down a list of objectives/problems that you want to discuss on a white board. 

**2. Use a parking lot.**

Often times the discussion will start to drift of in directions far from the scope of the meeting. A lot of times these discussion can be interesting and can open avenues for interesting and profitable work. Use the parking lot to acknowledge the idea and record it. This will make sure that the participant is heard and also keep the discussion in scope. 

**3. Keep record of the meeting and send minutes to all participants**

One of the most important but often neglected actions required after the meeting is for the someone to send the meeting mintues and action items. There are multiple reasons to write a good meeting minutes. The obvious reason is to keep record of what was talked about in the meeting. Action items work really well at telling people what they need to do and by when. Especially junior employees who are not great at self management find this very useful. 

**4. Make sure contributions are spread out**

A lot of times a single person will dominate the meeting talk for more than their share. Call them out and make sure that others get a chance to voice their opinions. 

**5. Ban technology for very focused meetings**

Some meetings require absolute focus from every participant. Ban technology for such meetings. It will be easier to implement this with your own group than when your boss is also part of the meeting. 

**6. Keep it short**

Most people like to schedule meetings for an hour. In my opinion, a lot of these meetings can be completed in 15-30 mins. I would suggest reserving 30 mins. for meetings with 3 or less people.
