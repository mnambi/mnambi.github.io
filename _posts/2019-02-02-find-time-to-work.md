You will hear a lot of people complain that their schedule is completely filled with meetings and they do not get enough time to do actual work. This is a very tricky problem to solve. You want to be in at least some of these meetings because important decisions are being made and some of them might be very relevant to your work which will affect your carreer trajectory. On the other hand, too many meetings can leave you with fragmented pockets of time scattered throughout the work week. 

Personally, I have observed that I am effective when I get chunks of time that are larger than 2 hours. Part of that two hour period is taken up by switching between tasks. About 5-10 mins at the beginning is lost due to context switching. At end of the time slot, another 5-10 or possibly more time is lost to prepare for the next meeting. If you are not preparing for the meeting, you might also be losing time in the meeting because you are not getting the most out of it.

An effective solution that I have found for this problem is to treat your work as a meeting. A meeting that just lasts a longer amount of time and it happens througout the week. I add 3-hour work meetings in my calendar dedicated for focused work. To overcome the problem of being able to attend important meetings, I leave about 3-8 hours of free time in my calendar that others can find me free to be added to their meetings. Also, I add my work meetings one week at a time and just for the coming week. This is my way of ensuring that I at least know about the meeting the week before it. As a result, once the week starts, I do not get pulled into random meetings for that week. If someone has an emergency and absolutely has to talk to you, they typically reach out and ask if you there is time in your schedule because Outlook or other mail clients would have told them that you are busy all week. This gives you the opportunity to weigh the importance of the issue and then decide if you want to give up work time to be in this meeting. 

Another secondary advantage of this technique is that once your work meeting is done, you can add in your calendar about the work you accomplished during that work meeting. This lets you keep track of time that you worked on a problem. Or if have weekly reporting responsibilities, you can pull your calendar and tell exactly what you did the last week.
