Graphs are very powerful tools for conveying information. Text worth a page or more can be all condensed within a single graph that would span for less than a single page. Graphs can help visualize complex relations and comparison. It is also a double-edged sword; if not used correctly, can result is reducing the impact of your work. In this post, I am focussing on graphs that are premdominantly used for conveying technical data. 

The motivation for this post is to keep a record of what I learned about presenting technical data using graphs in graduate school. As I have been out of academia for a while now, I feel like I am losing my technical writing/presenting skills. Writing these posts are my way of keeping them current. 

### 1. Design
While designing your graph, think about your target audience and how they are going to use it. Are they going to look at this graph just once? Are they going to come back to it again and again? Will they print it? or they are tech savvy and mostly look at it on a computer? This not a comprehensive list, but just a few things that you might want to consider when desiging your graph. 

- #### Line styles, colors, and markers
    As far as possible, use different line styles, different color, and different markers for each dataset. The important question to ask is if a person prints out this graphic, will he be able to differentiate between the different datasets.  

- #### Selecting colors
    Avoid using light colors like yellow on a white background. It might be visible on your computer screen, but while presenting on a different screen with high brightness or when printing the graphic on paper, the yellow lines will be faded out.

- #### Legends
    Legends should match the order of trends in the graph either in the ascending or descending order. 

- #### Font sizes
Choose your font sizes to be large enough that they will be visible. A hard-to-see text is worse than text that does not exit. The audience will focus on reading the text (X-axis, Y-axis), and miss most of what you are saying. This problem could be alleviated if you setup your graph well. See below for what I mean by setup your graph. 


### 2. Presentation
- #### Setup your graph
    By setting up your grpah, I mean providing all the information that the audience needs to know to make sense of the graph. I would suggest going in the following order: 
    1. Explain what data is plotted along the axes of your graph. I would do this even for standard plots even though they are obivous and someone knowledge in the field should know them. 
    2. Follow this by explaining data from which experiments/studies are shown in the plot and how the legend represents them. 
    3. I would then present the main trend that you want to enlighten the audience about. 
    4. This could be followed by any secondary trends that are shown by the data. This should happen before (iii) if explaning secondary trends is vital to understanding the main trend. 

- #### Time 
    I often find that speakers don't spend enough time explaining their graphs. The amount of time spent on a graphs should be proportional to the number of lines in the graph. Personally, I like to spend at least 10 seconds for each trend line on the graph.
